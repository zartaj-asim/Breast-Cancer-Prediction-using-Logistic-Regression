# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression

This project demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on features from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The dataset includes various measurements related to the tumor, and the goal is to classify the tumors into two categories: malignant (M) or benign (B).

## Features

    Logistic Regression for binary classification.
    Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
    Data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation.
    
## Dataset

The dataset used is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which includes features extracted from breast cancer biopsies. The dataset is in CSV format and contains various measurements for each sample.
